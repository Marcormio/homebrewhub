*Homebrew Hub* is a community project aiming to collect, archive and save every "unofficial" game, homebrew, patch, hackrom for Game Boy (Color) produced by the community through years of passionate work.

This repository is the software powering the website frontend and backend: basically, a Node application implementing a light CMS (no administration backend) showcasing a list of game/software entries.

Each entry can be voted, shared, discussed and played online.
